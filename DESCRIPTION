Description: An implementation of the 1-Sample Wilcoxon Sign rank test for medians. 
              It includes 2 functions, W_stat(), which computes the 
              exact probabilities of the Wilcoxon Sign Rank Test Statistic, W.
              The second function, Wilcox.m.test() allows the user to conduct the
              1-Sample Wilcoxon Sign Rank hypothesis test for medians, this also 
              allows the user to conduct the hypothesis test for the normal approximation, 
              based on the techniques of Bickel and Doksum (1973, ISBN:013850363X).
